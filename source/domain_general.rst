Sakai & Passingham's Domain General Hierarchy:
================================================

Sakai and Passingham [53,54] have demonstrated
that activation during a preparatory interval in the
anterior DLPFC/frontal polar cortex (FPC) correlates with
activation in the caudal superior frontal gyrus (BA 8) or
caudal inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44) depending on whether
an upcoming task is spatial or verbal, respectively


However, a recent experiment [55] has demonstrated that patients
with damage to the anterior DLPFC/FPC, and who exhibit
task-switching deficits, are still capable of establishing
normal pre-task activation in the preserved regions of
posterior PFC. Notably, functional connectivity among
the full network of task-related regions is disturbed, indicating
that maintenance of higher-order rules in anterior
DLPFC might serve to establish effective network
dynamics among task-related regions.
