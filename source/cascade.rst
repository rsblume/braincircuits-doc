Koechlin's Cascade of Hierarchical Cognitive Control Theory
============================================================

In cascade,
control resolves competition among alternative action
representations based on mutual information with contextual
information, also termed control signals. Crucially,
the control signals relate to one another hierarchically, in
that information is inherited from superordinate to subordinate
levels, and separate signals are processed by
spatially distinct regions along the rostroâ€“caudal axis of
the PFC.
