Stability & Degeneracy of modules
==================================
.. _stability mod:

* If we want to directly interpret an output of community detection we need some indication of how stable the partition is
* There are algorithms that for *attacking* a partition or particular module
* Methods for looking for embedded some nodes are in a particular module 
* Could test multiple additional probabilistic methods
