Prefrontal Dorsal and Ventral Auditory Streams (Rob)
=====================================================
.. _dlvl_audrestnet:


* Do the dorsal and ventral streams emanating from auditory cortex project to separable regions in prefrontal cortex(PFC)
* If so, do these regions dorsoventrally organized and do these streams demonstrate a rostrocaudal gradient?
* This would have important implications for the dorsal language stream
* The purpose of this experiment would be test these hypotheses using fMRI BOLD resting state analyses


Background
-----------
* In the cognitive control literature, there is wide consensus and evidence that inferior and middle frontal gyri both play important and potentially distinct roles in implementing high-level bvehavior
* The language literature, clearly points to importance of IFG, but most studies fail to implicate MFG
* In fact, some studies from the language literature ascribe certain high-level language functions to IFG that in the cognitive control are thought to be implemented by MFG in the cognitive control literature
* The first aim of this project would be to first identify whether the auditory dorsal stream, which is a fundamentally important network for language processing, projects to the MFG 
* The second aim would be to examine more closely the function of this dorsal PFC region by utilizing fMRI tasks that are combine cognitive control and language processing within the ecologically plausible setting of solving puzzles/mystery....


Hypotheses
-----------
*  Do the dorsal and ventral streams emanating from auditory cortex project to separable regions in PFC?

Design
---------
* Resting state analysis
* Multiple seeds, rostrocaudally organized over auditory cortex
* Look for separable DL and VL rostrocaudal streams (vis a vis Blumenfeld et al 2011)
