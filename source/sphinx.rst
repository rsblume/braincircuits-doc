Sphinx
========

Sphinx is a lightweight program for creating documentation in Python. 
	* Sphinx uses restructured text
	* It can integrate with your python modules to automatically generate documentation based on your *docstrings*
	
Go `here <http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html>`_ for all things Sphinx

**When you are in your root documentation directory this command will build your html files**::
	
	sphinx-build -b html source build
