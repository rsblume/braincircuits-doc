Kristoff's Relational Complexity Control Heterarchy:
=====================================================


However, as higher-order relationships depend
on lower-order relationships, higher levels need not asymmetrically
influence lower-levels. Indeed, modulation
could reasonably be assumed to occur in both directions
[56]. Thus, relational complexity is heterarchical, requiring
neither modulation nor inheritance of information
asymmetrically from higher to lower levels. This feature
might distinguish this framework from
