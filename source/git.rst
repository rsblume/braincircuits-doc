Git
=======

Git is a really handy way of doing version control. It is ideal for projects when a lot of people are touching documents
It is probably a wise idea to keep your scripts under version control, but not your data

.. Important::
   Git is a little counter-intuitive and can have a steep initial learning curve, but it is worth the initial investment
