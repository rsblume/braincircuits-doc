Badre & D'Esposito's Representational Hierarchy
=======================================

Hierarchy is ordered by control demand defined based on the form of the representations that compete during action selection

Action representations might be organized hierarchically, such that more abstract action representations designate a set of more specific representations.

For example, a task-set can be said to be abstract because it generalizes across a set of specific stimulus–response mappings. 

As representations at progressively abstract levels compete, distinct control processors along the rostro–caudal axis of the PFC might resolve the competition.


Levels of the hierarchy:
==========================

**Response control:** first-order abstraction

	color --> response mapping

	colors are competing


**Feature control:** second-order abstraction

	color + feature --> response mapping

	features of objects are competing


**Dimension control:** third-order abstraction

	color + feature match (feature + feature) --> response mapping

	dimensions shared between objects are competing


**Context control:** fourth-order abstraction
	
	color + feature match(feature + feature) --> response mapping 1 + color + feature match(feature + feature) --> response mapping 2

	task-sets are competing
















Representational:
As
noted earlier, action representations might be organized
hierarchically, such that more abstract action representations
designate a set of more specific representations.
For example, a task-set can be said to be
abstract because it generalizes across a set of specific
stimulus–response mappings. As representations at progressively
abstract levels compete, distinct control processors
along the rostro–caudal axis of the PFC might
resolve the competition.
